## Import libraries in C
### Basic
* How to use import libraries
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "lib/my_lib.h>"
```
1. `<>` means find and use the library in C directory which the c compiler's default C directory.
2. `""` means find and use the library in relative path from the file located.

### Header files
* In C, a function should be declared before used. If you want to add new function which can be used in another funciton, you should declare it prior than a function what use this function.
* Header file can solve this problem. You can declare only functions not definitions in a header file and include this header file inside of your C file. With this, a compiler aleady know function name you just added and it can reference its body later(link).

### Using `#ifndef`
* Using `#define` clause for define header file name.
```c
# common.h
#ifndef __COMMON_H__
#define __COMMON_H__
#include "stdio.h"
#include "stdlib.h"
#endif
# ###########
# main.c
#include "common.h"
```
* With this, prevent dupliated libraries importing inside of entire project.
